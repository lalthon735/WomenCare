## WomenCare: Revolutionizing Menstrual Health Through Technology üå∏

**[Project Demo](project.mp4)**

**WomenCare** is an innovative solution developed for the AITEX Community Health Hackathon, designed to transform menstrual health management and sanitary pad distribution.

Our platform consists of two interconnected components:

The **distribution portal** serves **NGOs**, **government agencies**, and **manufacturers** by implementing AI-driven forecasting to optimize sanitary pad allocation and distribution. This system uses advanced machine learning to predict regional needs with increasing accuracy over time.

The **user application** empowers **women** with personalized menstrual cycle predictions, health monitoring, and access to resources. Our deep learning algorithms analyze individual patterns to provide accurate forecasts and detect potential health concerns early.

## Vision & Mission üí°

In many regions worldwide, menstrual health remains stigmatized and under-addressed. Access to basic hygiene products is limited, education is sparse, and cultural barriers persist. We've combined our expertise in data science and AI to create a solution that bridges these gaps, providing both logistical support to organizations and personal empowerment to women.

## Technical Implementation üõ†

### Core Architecture ‚öô

Organizations implementing WomenCare receive a complete ecosystem for optimizing sanitary pad distribution through predictive analytics. The system functions in both online and offline environments, using innovative solutions like QR code-based data sharing to reach remote areas without reliable internet access.

Women using our application gain comprehensive menstrual cycle tracking with AI-powered predictions, health monitoring with anomaly detection, and integrated support resources. The platform includes features for accessing medical consultation and reporting instances of discrimination or violence.

### Enhanced Features üé®

Our platform incorporates extensive data visualization and educational resources. We're committed to continuous improvement through collaboration with women's health experts to ensure the highest quality information and support.

### Operational Flow ü¶æ

The system implements a streamlined yet comprehensive workflow:

#### Distribution Portal üèõ

Organizations can estimate potential users in a target region and collect data either through direct digital engagement or field workers. Our AI engine then predicts precise needs at specific locations, with accuracy improving after each cycle. Distribution efficiency is monitored through QR tracking, with detailed analytics available for stakeholders and funders. Women can request supplies directly through the application.

#### User Application üë©

Women record their menstrual cycles, receiving predictions for future cycles including bleeding days and fertility windows. The system provides alerts for cycle irregularities, enabling early detection of potential health issues. Users can request medical assistance or report harassment through integrated features.

### Key Capabilities üîç

#### Distribution Portal üèõ

- **AI-powered forecasting** for precise sanitary pad demand estimation
- **Comprehensive ecosystem** integrating organization and user interfaces
- **Adaptive functionality** operating with or without internet connectivity
- **Offline data exchange** using QR codes between users and organization representatives

#### User Application üë©

- **Personalized cycle prediction** covering menstruation, fertility windows, and key phase transitions
- **Health monitoring** with alerts for cycle irregularities that may indicate medical concerns
- **Support portal** for reporting discrimination or violence
- **Integrated healthcare access** through direct connection features

### Implementation Strategy üèó

WomenCare's strength lies in its minimal hardware requirements. Organizations can deploy it on existing servers, while the user application is optional and works on any mobile device. Our vision is a network where the distribution portal collaborates with numerous user applications. However, we recognize that economic barriers often prevent women who lack access to sanitary products from owning mobile devices. Our solution addresses this through AI-optimized distribution, which improves as more data becomes available.

### Adaptability üìê

The platform dynamically responds to environmental changes and events like epidemics or humanitarian crises by immediately incorporating user-reported data into prediction models, ensuring maximum responsiveness to evolving situations.

### Long-term Impact üìà

WiselyAndHealthy addresses persistent global challenges. According to BBC research, approximately 23 million girls abandon school annually after beginning menstruation, and only 36% of 355 million menstruating women in developing regions use proper sanitary products.

Our solution extends to remote regions through offline functionality, significantly improving access for underserved populations. Women receive comprehensive services beyond product access, including cycle tracking, health monitoring, and educational resources. They can plan activities around their cycles, visualize historical data, access health information, and request medical assistance or report discrimination through simple interface options.

## Development Process üèó

After conceptualizing our core solution, we searched extensively for datasets to train our models. Finding limited public data, we established rigorous criteria for both data collection and application development.

We conducted extensive research on existing solutions and their limitations, applying interdisciplinary approaches to overcome these challenges.

Our team analyzed both charitable and commercial sanitary product distribution models to identify optimal operational frameworks.

We've prepared all necessary materials for the AITEX Community Health Hackathon and look forward to continuing development of WomenCare.

## Future Development ‚è±

We're fully committed to advancing WomenCare beyond this hackathon. While our team has the technical expertise to develop the distribution portal, we recognize that the user application requires specialized knowledge in women's health. We're actively seeking partnerships with experts in this domain to ensure our solution meets the complex needs of women across diverse contexts.

We believe that meaningful change requires moving beyond awareness to action, and WomenCare represents our contribution to addressing this crucial global health challenge.
